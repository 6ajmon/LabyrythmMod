# Labyrythm

**A Minecraft Mod for Neoforge 1.21.1**

Labyrythm is a challenging content mod developed for the **Koło Naukowe Informatyków UMK (Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń Computer Science Student's Association)** Minecraft Modding Competition. The name of the mod combines "Labyrinth" and "Rhythm," reflecting the mod's core features: a dangerous maze and sound-based boss mechanics.

## Description

Prepare to delve into the darkness! Labyrythm introduces the **Minotaur's Labyrinth**, a vast, procedurally generated dungeon. This structure draws heavy inspiration from Minecraft's Deep Dark and Ancient Cities, featuring winding corridors covered in sculk.

Within the heart of this maze lurks the **Minotaur**, a fearsome new boss. Be warned: the Minotaur is blind and hunts using sound, similar to the Warden. Every step you take, every block you place, could alert it to your presence. Stealth and careful planning are key to survival – hence the "Rhythm" in the mod's name.

Those brave enough to explore the labyrinth and confront the Minotaur can discover powerful new items, including the formidable **Minotaur's Axe**, found in chests and as drops from the boss itself.

## Key Features

* **Minotaur's Labyrinth:** A new, procedurally generated surface structure themed after the Deep Dark and Ancient Cities.
* **The Minotaur:** A challenging new boss that is blind and reacts to sounds made by the player.
* **Sound-Based Gameplay:** Navigate the sculk-infested labyrinth carefully to avoid attracting the Minotaur.
* **New Loot:** Discover powerful items, including the Minotaur's Axe, within the labyrinth's chests and as a reward for defeating the boss.
